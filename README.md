# 447-GroupE
We are creating "Extreme Battleship" as a web based game.    

Organization Directories:  
    There are currently 4 directories, each is labled with what it should contain.  
    Feel free to add a directory, but make sure you explain it here.  
    Assets:  
        Store sprites, sounds, and other game assets in this folder.  
    Database:  
        Store database files, and files related to creating/managing the database  
        in this directory.  
    Pages:  
        This directory should contain mostly HTML, and related pages.  
    Scripts:  
        A folder for Javascript, and Python  script files. This will likely  
        contain other types of script files also.
