Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

First in your terminal write command "npm i express socket.io" so you have socket.io installed on your system

Also "npm i --save-dev nodemon" in the terminal. This will monitor the node server so that any changes that are made, this will automaticlly restart it for you. This will only be in the development

After this, type "npm run dev" into the terminal and the game should be ready to go. So now go to your browser and plug "127.0.0.1:3000" into your search bar and the game should show up. For the multiplayer you'll want to open 2 tabs of the game board, one for each player.
