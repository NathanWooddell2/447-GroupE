To keep the README.md easily readable, please document files with a format like below:

FILE DIRECTORY
    FILENAME.ext
        A description of what the file does, and to what extent it is complete.

        If there are any external functions/data structures created here please
        describe them in an easily readable way.

        "Creator Name"

If you have suggestions to make this better please let me know :)
